# Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge


#### Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Obective
The purpose of this project is to analyze and predict house prices in Ames, Iowa using a dataset which incorporates housing data from 2006 - 2010.

## Project Description

This project uses the [train.csv](../datasets/train.csv) dataset to train the model; however, the final dataset, titled: [cleaned, mapped, dummied.csv](../datasets/Working Data/cleaned_mapped_dummied.csv)
 can be found in the Working Data folder. Descriptions of the final dataset can found in the [data dictionary](../data dictionary.md):

### Conclusion
Through an extensive and iterative process, I deployed Linear Regression, LASSO, and Ridge models against the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. I was able to identify a number of features that strongly correlated to sales price. The model that I chose to generate market insights utilized Linear Regression with SalePrice as its target. With the existing features from the dataset as well as engineered (modified) features, I was able to predict the sales price of a house within $33,000. I was also able to identify the pricing impact of the addition of multiple features on the overall sale price. This is information I in turn share with my customers.
